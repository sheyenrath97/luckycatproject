    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Cats have been a part of my life since early childhood. Their presence brings me peace, luck, and comfort.</p>

    <h2>My Cat</h2>
    <p>My best friend is my large grey and white cat who loves to sit around and eat all day. He likes to play with string and sleep on my laundry.
    <h2>Why I Love Them</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cats were there when people weren’t.</li>
      <li>They bring a sense of luck and emotional comfort.</li>
    </ul>
